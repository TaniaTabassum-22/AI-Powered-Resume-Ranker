# 🎯 AI-Powered Resume Ranker  
An intelligent resume-ranking system built with Python & NLP.

---

## 🔍 Overview  
In today’s fast-moving hiring world, recruiters are often swamped with resumes.  
This project leverages AI and NLP to **automatically evaluate and rank candidate resumes** — enabling faster, fairer, and data-driven hiring decisions.  
The Resume Ranker ingests resumes, processes them, extracts meaningful information, computes a ranking score, and outputs a ranked list of candidates with insights.

---

## 💡 Motivation  
- Manual resume screening is time-consuming and prone to inconsistency.  
- An AI-powered approach can help reduce unconscious bias, improve efficiency, and ensure top talent doesn’t slip through the cracks.  
- As part of my BE in CSE (AIML) and my full-stack/AI project experience, I wanted to build something practical that bridges NLP with real-world hiring tools.

## ✨ Features  
- ✅ Extracts structured data from raw resumes (skills, experience, education, keywords)  
- ✅ Applies NLP techniques (tokenization, keyword matching, embeddings) to build candidate profiles  
- ✅ Computes a ranking score based on customizable weights (skills match, experience depth, education relevance)  
- ✅ Outputs a ranked list of resumes with scores and highlights (why this candidate ranks higher)  
- ✅ Modular Python architecture—easy to extend and customise

## 🧱 Architecture
Raw Resumes → NLP Pre-processing → Feature Extraction → Ranking Model → Ranked Output + Insights

---

- **Resume Processor:** Reads PDF/DOCX/TXT files, cleans text  
- **Feature Extractor:** Parses for skills, years of experience, education level, keywords  
- **Ranker:** Applies weighted scoring or trained model to compute final ranking  
- **Output Module:** Generates ranked list with score explanation
